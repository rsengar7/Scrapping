https://greensquaredcertified.ecomedes.com/products/florida-tile/sequence,Florida Tile,Sequence,"SequenceHDP is inspired by the elegant Varana stone found in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy. With its light grey coloration, small compact granules and contrasting wave-like veining, Varana stone is the material of choice on altars and baptismal fonts throughout that area. Florida Tile’s unique interpretation of this stone, SequenceHDP brings versatile color and size options in a color body glazed porcelain tile that realizes an ideal palette for designers. The tone-on-tone veining in SequenceHDP allows for beautiful shade variations in each of its four color choices: Breeze, a light dove tone with waves of a neutral beige; Drift, a warm taupe accentuated with darker greys and browns; Current, a medium grey with steel blue-grey delineations; and Vortex, a dark slate grey with black graphic effects. Available in three rectified large-format sizes: 12x24, 24x24 and 18x36; and a rectified plank 9x36, all feature a soft, flat surface and rectified edges allowing for tight, nearly seamless installations. Complementing the field tile are two mosaics; the first is a herringbone pattern made of 1x3 strips that give the product an upscale look commonly found in natural stone. The other is an oversized 4"" hexagon pattern; both designs are mesh-mounted and sized at 12x12. Completing the collection is a 3x24 bullnose trim. Both the mosaics and bullnose are available in all four collection colors. As part of Florida Tile’s newest innovation in product development, SequenceHDP incorporates Microban® antimicrobial technology into the tile surface. Manufactured using proprietary HDP—High Definition Porcelain® printing technology and with the technical performance of porcelain, the SequenceHDP collection is appropriate for all applications in both residential and commercial settings. SequenceHDP is entirely made in the USA in our Green Squared® certified, Advanced Manufacturing Center in Lawrenceburg, KY of 40% pre-consumer recycled content.

https://greensquaredcertified.ecomedes.com/products/florida-tile/precious,Florida Tile,Precious,"From the exquisite beauty of Calacatta marble emerges PreciousHDP, a collection from Florida Tile that captures the essence of the most sought after natural stone in the world. Inspired by the unique marked graphics in the Italian stone, PreciousHDP is a distinct expression of refined taste. Intense grey and brown veins stand out from a crystalline white background endowing it with a depth and movement that enlivens spaces. The random pattern, the structured surfaces of the decors, and the natural and polished finishes are elements that elevate any atmosphere – classical or modern. Rectified, porcelain floor tiles in a natural finish are available in 12x24, 24x24, and 18x36. Rectified, ceramic wall tiles in a polished finish are available in 5x14, 14x27, and 14x39.

PreciousHDP also features a 14x27 Curl ceramic wall deco with a chic, three-dimensional wave pattern in a polished finish, adding a bold twist to the classic Calacatta stone look.

https://greensquaredcertified.ecomedes.com/products/florida-tile/alava-hdp,Florida Tile,Alava HDP,"The AlavaHDP line is named after a region in Northwestern Spain, known for its rugged rocky landscape and tradition of being one of the most productive logging centers of southern Europe. Appropriately, the AlavaHDP line is exactly that. A unique concept for the American tile industry which marries two completely different materials into a single line. The concept is perfect for breaking up a space with different but complimenting textures while at the same time keeping a cohesive color scheme. Composed of 3 contemporary colors, AlavaHDP presents a unique twist by combining a stone and a wood look in a single product line, within the same color. Each color is presented in 4 formats (12x12, 12x24, 6x24 and 8x36). The 12x12 and 12x24 tiles are composed of a roughly hewn stone graphic with a high shade variation and a slightly distressed surface texture. The 6x24 and 8x36 sizes carry the same color tones as the stone, but are presented in a rustic reclaimed wood that is complete with nail holes, worn in stains and a soft wood grain texture. AlavaHDP is Made in the USA of 40% pre-consumer recycled content, is GREENGUARD® and Porcelain Tile Certified, and meets the new DCOF AcuTest requirements to be installed in wet areas.",,,Yes,Yes,"Industry Wide (4789101745.101.1),Certified by ,UL Environment,valid 2020-04-01 to 2025-04-01","Yes,ANSI A138.1-2011 GREEN SQUARED American Standard Specifications for Sustainable Ceramic Tiles, Glass Tiles and Tile Installation Materials,Certified by ,UL Environment",Yes,Yes,Yes,"83733-410,UL 2818 - 2013 Standard for Chemical Emissions for Building Materials, Finishes and Furnishings,Certified by ,UL Environment,valid until 2022-11-08","83733-420,UL 2818 - 2013 Gold Standard for Chemical Emissions for Building Materials, Finishes and Furnishings,Certified by ,UL Environment,valid until 2022-11-08",https://whytile.com/library/tile-green-building-credits-requirements/,https://whytile.com/library/life-cycle-cost-study/,https://whytile.com/library/tcna-tile-natural-choice/

This new product line is a stylized interpretation of vein cut stone. Specifically a linear cut Travertine or Limestone known as ""Georgette"". This look in its natural form is a stunning linear play of tone on tone colors that create this contemporary look. Using Florida Tile’s HDP-High Definition Porcelain technology however, we not only reproduce this stone look, but we are able to let our imaginations go wild with bold color combinations that can’t be found in nature. From bold Blues to Steel Gray and Dark Brown, we created contemporary colors that can be specified in any commercial space. Each color has a unique blend of complimentary colors within its veining to add interest and depth, as well as pair beautifully with other design finishes. This glazed porcelain floor and wall is available in pressed 12x24 with a 3x24 bullnose for each color. We have also added a unique patterned M12 mosaic that rotates each chip 90 degrees, to create a wonderful checkerboard pattern.

https://greensquaredcertified.ecomedes.com/products/florida-tile/natura-hdp,Florida Tile,Natura HDP,"Natura HDP by Florida Tile is another beautiful series to bear the HDP symbol of High Definition Porcelain. Created to signify a revolutionary new product category, HDP utilizes the most technically advanced glazing system in the industry today, digital printing. Like the technology that changed the television industry, High Definition Porcelain brings you the most realistic image possible, except it is on a tile. Digital technology uses 500 injectors to print with greater variety and less repetition in the overall pattern. This process allows for a production pattern that is not repeated for 180 ft. This is 8 times the variation of a conventional Roto-color machine and a far better resolution. This is a huge leap forward in both resolution and pattern variation, creating a porcelain tile that is virtually indistinguishable from real wood. While the look is what draws your eye, High Definition Porcelain products from Florida Tile combine the best of both worlds, a rugged and low maintenance tile that looks just like real wood. One look at the NaturaHDP series and you will know immediately that you have never seen anything so real in a manufactured product.",,,Yes,Yes,"Industry Wide (4789101745.101.1),Certified by ,UL Environment,valid 2020-04-01 to 2025-04-01","Yes,ANSI A138.1-2011 GREEN SQUARED American Standard Specifications for Sustainable Ceramic Tiles, Glass Tiles and Tile Installation Materials,Certified by ,UL Environment",Yes,Yes,Yes,"25795-410,UL 2818 - 2013 Standard for Chemical Emissions for Building Materials, Finishes and Furnishings,Certified by ,UL Environment,valid until 2022-11-08","25795-420,UL 2818 - 2013 Gold Standard for Chemical Emissions for Building Materials, Finishes and Furnishings,Certified by ,UL Environment,valid until 2022-11-08",https://whytile.com/library/tile-green-building-credits-requirements/,https://whytile.com/library/life-cycle-cost-study/,https://whytile.com/library/tcna-tile-natural-choice/
https://greensquaredcertified.ecomedes.com/products/florida-tile/mingle-hdp,Florida Tile,Mingle HDP,"min·gle (ming g l) V.tr. ""To mix or bring together in combination, usually without loss of individual characteristics. "" The classic definition of Mingle, comes in a new line from Florida Tile. Mingle HDP abandons the conventional concept of what a stone installation needs to look like. We have re-imagined and repurposed the tradition. By dissecting the classic looks of Travertine, Marble and Limestone down to their basic graphical properties, there were elements that, regardless of the pattern, could all work together. We were then able to piece them back together to create a cohesive new look that both blends in and stands out at the same time. What we achieved is a concept that uses a combination of multiple stone graphics in the same color. Working with a strong Travertine and Breccia Marble, along with a more subdued Limestone, we intricately paired them together in the same tone to create a single color. Conceptualized as a 4 color line, we decided to make 2 colors mixing the graphics, an Ivory (Warm Winter Mix) and a Grey (Cool Summer Mix). The other two colors, a Bluish Grey (Dry Stream) created using only the Travertine graphics, and a warm Beige tone (Soft Rock) created using only the Breccia Marble graphic. Together these colors represent a new and exciting trend that will soon make its mark on the industry. Delivered in a 4 format offering, this glazed porcelain floor and wall tile is available in 12x12, 18x18, 12x24 all pressed and a new contemporary 6x24, cut from a pre-scored 12x24. With a smooth flat surface and square edge, this stone look is given a soft touch provided by a final top glaze ""toppa"" application that catches the light and adds characteristic veining to the line. Full trims are available in bullnose, chair rails and chair rail stops as well as an M12 mosaic. Decoratives offered are two 1.5x12 mosaic listellos and four 6x6 inserts that use a Bronze metallic glaze application over the stone graphic of the line. The listellos and inserts feature a mix of 60’s inspired designs like Chevron and Starburst that are gaining in popularity as contemporary design again, looks to the past.

The product is offered in 10 different designs with translucent characteristics that not only reflect but also refract light. This allows the grout to transition in color to complement the tile color. MAPEI Flexcolor 3D is also formulated for commercial and residential installations with porcelain, ceramic, glass and natural-stone tiles. MAPEI Flexcolor 3D can be used to grout interior tile. Plus, the dense surface structure of the grout helps to prevent water-based stains on the grout surface. MAPEI Flexcolor 3D is formulated with the latest innovation in recycled glass bead aggregate, which ensures color consistency, ease of cleanability and improved workability. In addition, this grout can be used on sensitive tile surfaces once tested, requires no sealer and cures naturally from evaporation.
